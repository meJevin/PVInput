This program only works on windows.

To use this program simply apply a chroma-key effect onto it in your favorite screen-capture software.

For example, in OBS, in order to remove the green background and only have keys displayed you'll have to follow steps below
	- Add a new source, as a Window Capture
	- Select PVInput
	- In Color Key, check 'Use Color Key' and select the color of your background in PVInput.
	- Set Similarity and Blend options to your liking. I recommend these: Similarity = 65, Blend = 20
	- Optionally, you can select a sub-region of PVInput to capture only the keyboard or only the mouse
